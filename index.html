            <p>
              The Mercedes-AMG F1 W11 EQ Performance is an evolution of last
              year’s contender – the car that won Mercedes its historic sixth
              consecutive double championship.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team has looked at a myriad of areas to improve the car and
              has changed the vast majority of the over 10,000 parts of the car
              to extract more performance. The Mercedes-AMG F1 W11 EQ
              Performance is expected to become the fastest Mercedes race car
              ever built.
            </p>
            <p>
              “The regulations stayed largely the same for the new year, so for
              us it was all about trying to make sure that we don’t run out of
              development steam on a package that worked pretty well for us last
              year,” said James.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We wanted to change aspects of the concept of the car – aspects
              that would be completely impossible to change within a season – to
              give us a more fertile platform for the new season. We tried to
              make a few well-chosen architectural changes to keep the
              development slope strong even though the regulations are now a
              little bit longer in the tooth.”
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to many detail changes and smaller improvements, the
              team has introduced three larger changes – one at the front, one
              at the middle and one at the back of the car.

              “At the front we have accepted more structural complexity around
              the uprights and wheel rims in order to provide a higher
              performance assembly overall,” said James. “In the middle of the
              car we have followed the pitlane trend by moving our upper side
              impact tube to the lower position and banking the aerodynamic gain
              that comes with this layout.
            </p>
            <p>
              “At the rear of the car we have gone for an adventurous suspension
              layout in order to free up aerodynamic development opportunity.
              All three investments were improvements in their own right, but
              their real effect is to mobilize a raft of secondary aerodynamic
              gains both during the winter and, we hope, across the season to
              come.”
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, the team brought a significant upgrade to the car after
              the first week of testing that changed the look of the Melbourne
              car quite significantly compared to the launch car. This year, the
              race trim will be much closer to the car that is running at
              Silverstone today.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We will still have upgrades for Melbourne that will come in the
              second week of testing, but the ‘entire new car’ approach of 2019
              won’t feature,” said James. “Last year, the regulations were
              changed quite significantly, and they were decided quite late in
              the year.

              “Under those circumstances, doing a launch car and a week two car
              gave us the chance to build the maximum amount of learning into
              our Melbourne car. With the regulations being more mature this
              year and with the opening stab of the 2020 development already
              being at the same level as the finish of last year’s car,
              repeating last year’s approach would not make sense.”

              2020 is a special year for the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team as
              the outfit celebrates its 10th anniversary as the modern Mercedes
              works team in Formula One. On 14 March 2010, the new Mercedes F1
              team competed in its first race, the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix.
              Since then, the team has started in almost 200 Formula One Grands
              Prix (198), taken 93 victories, 194 podium places and 48 one-two
              wins.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It’s fantastic that the team is able to celebrate its ten-year
              anniversary,” said Toto Wolff. “We made our first come-back to F1
              over 25 years ago as an engine supplier and then we went all in
              ten years ago. It shows our long-term commitment – with our own
              works team and as a Power Unit supplier to valuable customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We have been a part of Formula One with changing technical
              regulations, with changes in the Daimler top management, but our
              commitment to the sport hasn’t changed. It’s great that we get to
              celebrate our tenth anniversary with the Mercedes works team as
              one further milestone of this commitment.”
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to many detail changes and smaller improvements, the
              team has introduced three larger changes – one at the front, one

            <h2>2021 changes make 2020 season more challenging</h2>
            <p>
              One of the biggest challenges in 2020 will be trying to find the
              right balance between developing the current car and preparing for
              the massive changes that will be introduce in F1 in the following
              year. 2021 will see the biggest change to the technical
              regulations in the history of Formula One which will require
              virtually every part of the car to be designed and developed from
              scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the technical complexity of the regulation change,
              the new financial regulations mean that teams will have to
              re-organise the way they tackle these changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              “2020 is an evolution of the current regulations and the gains
              will be smaller, so you need more time and effort to keep
              improving your car,” said Toto. “On the other hand, the 2021
              regulations are so very different that you need a lot of time to
              prepare for them. Every month you start later than your
              competitors will make it more difficult to catch up. You also have
              the effect of the cost cap which means that you will have fewer
              resources available to throw at things in 2021.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “It’s a massive challenge,” said Toto. “We had a lot of regulatory
              changes in recent years, but this time we’re effectively tackling
              a two-year project. Trying to get this right will make 2020 the
              most difficult season, but it is also an amazing opportunity. This
              team has shown time and again that it loves being challenged and
              we will face this one with the same passion and determination that
              has made Mercedes so strong in recent years.”
